In general, most email newsletters and forum update announcements are syndicated to the blog.

# Writing blog posts

Our blog is a part of our Shopify shop. To start a new blog post, navigate to [newblog.farm.bot](http://newblog.farm.bot) or find the blogging section in the Shopify admin panel.

Blog images should generally be the largest size available, but not "Original" size. This will allow them to be high resolution on large screens while minimizing file size. The exception is small images which should not be shown larger than their natural size.

Blog posts should be tagged with a couple of relevant tags such as `Software` or `FarmBot Genesis`.

When publishing, make sure the blog post visibility is set to **visible**! After publishing, double check [blog.farm.bot](http://blog.farm.bot) to ensure everything looks correct.
