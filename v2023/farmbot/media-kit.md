FarmBot is an exciting subject for **journalists**, **podcasters**, **YouTubers**, and more to cover. FarmBot is not only new technology that is still _unheard of by many_, it combines unique aspects not typically discussed in the technology, IoT, home automation, or agricultural sectors.

For example, [FarmBot is 100% open-source](https://farm.bot/pages/open-source), meaning all of the 3D CAD models, electronics schematics, and even the software source code is given away _for free_ to empower end-users to make modifications, repairs, and truly own their tech. This stands in stark contrast with most conventional agriculture companies who relentlessly patent their hardware, software, data, genetics, and more.

Depending on your audience, you may wish to focus on one of the myriad ways FarmBot is used:

- **At home** for self sufficiency, food sovereignty, sustainability, health, home automation.
- **At K-12 schools** as a teaching tool for robotics, engineering, agriculture, nutrition, biology.
- **At universities** as a research tool for growing methods, genetics, inputs, climate science.
- **Other uses** such as restoration, serving people with disabilities, industrial automation.
