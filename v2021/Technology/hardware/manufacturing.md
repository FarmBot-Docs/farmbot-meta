title="KPI: Cost/Unit"
content="Lowering the cost to manufacture kits is a critical pathway towards reaching more people with FarmBot technology. In our first few versions of FarmBot, our cost/kit actually raised due to increased quality and hardware features. Over time however, economies of scale and improvements to the manufacturing and supply chain should lower our cost to manufacture kits. Future product lines that are more simple and less expensive to produce will also help lower our average cost/unit."
