content="2021 was marked by hitting a noticeable stride in our ability to ship new software features, while also enduring hardware snags and an arduous development cycle for our next generation kits.

A major factor in our software success was our heavy investment in stability and test coverage of FarmBot OS that began in early 2020. While the rewrites and QA took substantial resources, the effort has allowed us to shorten the time it takes to fix bugs today and ship what feels like a record number of features this year. Additionally, maintaining a low amount of technical debt and enforcing a test coverage policy has improved our confidence in publishing new releases early and often. It is clear that continued investments in infrastructure, testing, and tooling are strategic towards shipping quality software quickly.

Meanwhile, 2021 was the year we unfortunately found more preventable issues in our hardware than ever before. This has prompted us to heavily invest in hardware testing, CAD model fidelity, part drawings and specifications, and also make extensive design improvements to the next generation of hardware. The design changes, along with the pandemic-impacted supply chain caused major delays in restocking our inventory in Q3 and Q4. However, it is looking like our efforts are just beginning to pay off, as they did with software 12 months ago.

Looking back at the long journey, I am appreciative and awed by all that we have accomplished. Moving ahead, I look forward to continuing on our current software trajectory and hitting new strides with hardware through 2022!

# Shipments

We sold out of most of our inventory early in the year in an unexpectedly strong Q1 and Q2. Due to pandemic related supply chain disruptions and the time required to develop the next generation of hardware, we were unable to restock our inventory for the rest of 2021, resulting in far fewer FarmBots shipped than sold. With a large number of outstanding pre-orders going into 2022, we expect next year's total shipments will be substantially greater.

|FarmBot           |Quantity Shipped|% of Total|
|------------------|---------------:|---------:|
|Express v1.0      |25              |13.7%     |

# Market breakdown

The following table breaks down our FarmBot sales into three main market segments based on end-use of the machine: **Education**, **Personal**, and **B2B**.

The Education segment includes K-12 schools, universities, and extracurricular educational programs such as 4H and robotics clubs. The Personal segment includes homeowners, families, and DIY enthusiasts who use FarmBot non-commercially. B2B includes family farms, research facilities, farm-to-fork restaurants, and other entities that are not in the business of education.

# Impact of the pandemic

While our revenue streams have largely stabilized with the reopening of schools and a renewed interest in being self-sufficient at home, the pandemic has continued to impact our internal manufacturing supply chain.

Due to the rising cost of microchips, aluminum, shipping, and many individual components in FarmBot, we will be increasing our prices approximately 10% starting January 15th, 2022. These price increases will help us to better keep inventory on our shelves and maintain margin through the year.
