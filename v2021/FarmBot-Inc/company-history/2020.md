content="2020 was the most uncertain year we have been in business. It was filled with new challenges across nearly all areas of our operation, and in some cases forced us to make tough decisions. From turnover within the company, to pandemic-induced manufacturing delays, to cancelling new products, there has been no shortage of adversity.

And yet, through all of this, we have come to find new strengths. From focusing our hardware offering, to doubling down on owning our software and documentation stacks, to prioritizing testing and stability, to shipping a record number of FarmBots, we have acomplished more in the last 12 months than perhaps in any other year.

Looking back at the ups and downs, I am proud of our accomplishments, humbled by the hardships, and excited by the path ahead. Here we come, 2021!

# Revenue

Despite a global downturn due to the pandemic, 2020 brought us 16% growth in revenue over 2019, making this our biggest year ever:

|Product           |2019\* Revenue  |2020\* Revenue  |% of 2020\* Total|
|------------------|---------------:|---------------:|----------------:|
|Express v1.0      |$130,024        |$86,692         |6.9%             |

|Genesis XL v1.4   |$88,646         |-               |-                |

|**TOTAL**         |**$1,081,328**  |**$1,257,380**  |**100.0%**       |

_\* From January 1st to December 22nd, includes refunds for orders placed in prior years. See [impact of the pandemic](#impact-of-the-pandemic) for more info._

# Shipments

We shipped more FarmBots during 2020\* than in any other year:

|Product           |Quantity Shipped|% of Total|
|------------------|---------------:|---------:|
|Express v1.0      |148             |20.7%     |
|Express XL v1.0   |153             |21.4%     |
|Genesis v1.5      |215             |30.1%     |
|Genesis XL v1.5   |199             |27.8%     |
|**TOTAL**         |**715**         |**100.0%**|

_\* From January 1st to December 22nd_

Strong numbers here can be attributed to three factors:

1. Year over year increase in sales of Genesis and Genesis XL.
2. The addition of FarmBot Express and Express XL to our lineup.
3. Two production runs were finished in 2020, with the first run having started in 2019 and encompassing the Express pre-order launch campaign.

# Market breakdown

The following table breaks down our FarmBot sales into three main market segments based on end-use of the machine: **Education**, **Personal**, and **B2B**.

The Education segment includes K-12 schools, universities, and extracurricular educational programs such as 4H and robotics clubs. The Personal segment includes homeowners, families, and DIY enthusiasts who use FarmBot non-commercially. B2B includes family farms, research facilities, farm-to-fork restuarants, and other entities that are not in the business of education.

# Impact of the pandemic

We began feeling the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak before it had gone worldwide. With our manufacturing partner based out of China, the first production run of our Express and Express XL v1.0 kits was delayed by approximately 3 months due to strict lockdowns.

By the time the manufacturing was completed and the kits were in our warehouse (May 12th), the virus had spread across the world imposing widespread school shutdowns, job losses, and uncertainty.

Between January 1st and May 12th, we recieved an unprecedented number of cancellation requests for delayed Express and Express XL orders - 56 in total, amounting to over $100k in lost revenue. Because refunds were for orders that were placed in 2019 were processed in 2020, sales figures for 2020 for the Express product line are substantially lower, while sales for 2019 are equally inflated on the order of $100k. Had we not experienced the manufacturing delay, we likely would have avoided most of these cancellations and seen much higher 2020 revenue and shipments for these kits.

Beyond the obvious cause and effect of the manufacturing delay, it is unclear how else the pandemic has affected our sales. On one hand, consumers are looking for ways to be more self sufficient and schools are adopting teaching tools that can be used for distance learning. On the other hand, financial uncertainty has dropped consumer spending and school closures have required educators to focus on making ends meet rather than developing new ways of teaching.
