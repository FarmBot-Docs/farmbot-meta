content="2024 was a difficult year for FamBot's sales. After finishing 2023 with modest growth from the prior year's downturn, I was hopeful 2024 would see another year of small gains. We went in with brand new inventory of Genesis and Genesis XL v1.7, featuring a much faster and easier setup process thanks to an all-new track design and the kits coming 90% pre-assembled for the first time. We also had plans to sunset the Express product line once we sold through our final inventory a few months into the year, allowing us to focus the business and marketing efforts on our higher-end, higher-margin Genesis line.

However, things got off to a rocky start. By the end of Q1 we were down 29% year over year due to a huge miss in revenue at the start of Spring - our busy season. By the end of Q2 things had only slightly improved to being down 27% from the same time in 2023. At this point, given our worst Q1 since 2017 and our worst Q2 since 2019, the existing cost structure of the business was unsustainable.

Looking at expenditures, the largest area we could save would be by significantly reducing our advertising budget. This had grown over the years to be between $16,000 and $18,000 per month (roughly 30% of operations) as the cost to reach people online had increased and as I strived to maintain web traffic levels despite fewer organic visitors coming through. I had always been scared of lowering our ad spend for fear that sales would dry up quickly without it; but with cashflow forcing our hand, in early July, I cut the monthly advertising budget by over 90% to just $1,500.

Along with other cost cutting measures put in place, the immediate financial stress on the company was relieved. However, with the number of monthly visitors to our website reduced from an average of 150k down to about 20k, our sales outlook was unpredictable.

The second half of the year turned out to have similarly poor performance as the first half of the year, with Q3 ending 29% down and Q4 ending 31% down compared to the same quarters in 2023. In total, we ended 2024 down 28% year over year.

Heading into 2025 feels more uncertain than perhaps at any other moment in the company's history. It is unclear if the long-term implications of limited advertising will result in a further decline of sales, or if we will stabilize at a new normal. While lower cost advertising efforts including influencer marketing and podcasting are being explored, these avenues have yet to prove themselves as significant drivers of the top line.

On the optimistic side, we now have a significantly reduced cost structure in place, plans to move into a smaller warehouse before the middle of the year, a full focus on only our Genesis line, further cost improvements coming with Genesis and Genesis XL v1.8, and the launch of the 3D farm designer nearing.

FarmBot has always aimed to deliver better and better technology, and the coming year will be no different. While these tough times have called for us to hunker down, I am hopeful we'll weather the storm to see new stability and a rebound in 2025.

# YoY revenue by product

Our **revenue decreased 28% in 2024** compared with 2023. This was in part due to the run through of our final Express and Express XL inventory in the first half of the year, followed by an adjustment period of only carrying Genesis and Genesis XL going forward.

However, the Genesis line (and Genesis XL in particular) were still down year over year despite significant improvements to the product with the launch of v1.7 and being in stock for over 95% of the year.

Individual part and partial kit sales also fell, though we have intentionally been resupplying a smaller variety of parts over the last two years due to the high cost of maintaining inventory.

# Market breakdown

The following table breaks down our FarmBot sales into three main market segments based on end-use of the machine: **Education**, **Personal**, and **B2B**.

The Education segment includes K-12 schools, universities, and extracurricular educational programs such as 4H and robotics clubs.
