content="As a matter of security and efficiency, not everyone will be granted access to all tools and resources. For example, people not involved with the warehouse and order fulfillment will not be given access to Shipstation.

In general, an employee will only be given access to a tool or resource if it is necessary for them to fulfill their responsibilities."
