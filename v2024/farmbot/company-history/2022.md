content="2022 brought the first downturn in FarmBot's growth since 2016. We experienced a 23% drop in revenue over 2021 in part due to the delayed first production runs of FarmBot Genesis v1.6 and Express v1.1, a lack of kits being available from inventory for most of the year, the ongoing economic impacts of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, and global supply chain shortages.

The financial pressure from the drop in revenue prompted us to re-examine costs and work to reduce spending across the company from shipping to marketing to servers. We also moved to a 4-day work week primarily to promote a healthier work/life balance, though with the added benefit of being a 25% wage increase for all employees on an hourly basis without incurring added cost.

Our products continued to improve over previous generations with the successful introduction of the FarmBot Genesis rotary tool, improved electronics in FarmBot Express v1.1, and a total of 20 software deployments throughout the year.

However, despite these improvements, it became more clear than ever that maintaining inventory is a necessity to drive growth. Thus, we reprioritized our hardware strategy with the top goal of maintaining inventory and deprioritized the goal of improving the hardware with each manufacturing run, which has historically introduced delays and risk.

2022 thus marked the first time we manufactured a version of FarmBot (Genesis v1.6) three times without substantial changes between runs, and we intend on further increasing the number of runs between versions going forward.

Through 2023, our focus will be on honing our business operations and product offerings to ensure we deliver the core values of FarmBot to the most people: stability, agricultural capabilities, ease of use, and being available from inventory. I look forward to seeing where this refined roadmap takes us!

# YoY revenue by product

Our revenue was down by 23% in 2022 compared with 2021. We believe this is due to a few factors including not having inventory available from stock for nearly the entire year, our increased prices due to the increased cost of manufacturing and shipping, and the economic uncertaininty and high energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine.

# Impact of the pandemic

The pandemic continued to impact our supply chain through the first half of 2022, resulting in longer-than-usual production times for sample parts, delayed sea shipping of production runs, and higher than normal sea shipping costs. We were also forced to make some product changes due to shortages of certain electronic components including Raspberry Pi computers and Molex connectors.

Most costs and delays came under control through the second half of the year, allowing for relatively quick second and third production runs of Genesis and Genesis XL v1.6.
