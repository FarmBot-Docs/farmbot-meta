content="2023 marked a year where we closely executed on delivering the core values of FarmBot to the most people: stability, agricultural capabilities, ease of use, and being available from inventory.

Early in the year we began a transition of our social media content and ad strategy from long-form to short-form video. This has breathed new life into our paid advertising, brought more yearly traffic to our website than ever before, and further increased our online following and brand awareness.

With the advent of generative AI, we integrated several AI-powered features into the web app including automatic Lua code generation from natural language prompts, allowing users of all technical skill levels to more easily unlock their FarmBot's potential.

We were able to maintain inventory of all FarmBot models through most of the year, with only a short preiod between the final Genesis v1.6 inventory leaving the warehouse and the arrival of new Genesis v1.7 kits. With the v1.7 design, FarmBot Genesis and Genesis XL now come 90% pre-assembled in the box and feature a completely revamped track design, significantly reducing setup time and complexity. Other hardware changes were focused on reducing the cost of goods sold and the shipped weight of the product.

And finally, with the analysis of our 2023 year-end sales data, we decided to put the Express product line on hold for the foreseeable future. While we will continue to sell remaining inventory and provide support for all Express customers, our manufacturing and innovation efforts will be concentrated exclusively on the Genesis product line going forward.

With a more focused and compelling hardware offering than ever, a growing online presence, and the ongoing improvements to our software and documentation, I look forward to seeing what 2024 will bring for FarmBot!

# YoY revenue by product

Our **revenue grew 5% in 2023** compared with 2022, with gains buoyed by a roughly 14% increase in YoY revenue from the Genesis product line.

Meanwhile, the Express product line saw a roughly 16% decrease in YoY revenue and an even steeper decrease in overall profitability due to rising COGS and lowered selling prices. This sales data, combined with the fact that the Genesis v1.7 kits come 90% pre-assembled (matching one of the main value propositions of Express), has led us to put the Express product line on hold for the foreseeable future.

While we will continue to sell remaining Express inventory and provide ongoing support for all Express customers, moving forward we will focus our manufacturing and innovation efforts exclusively on the Genesis product line.

# Shipments

We maintained inventory of all kits throughout most of the year, with the exception being Genesis standard sized kits which were out of stock for approximately 6 weeks during November and December. This resulted in a backlog of about 25 kits sold during 2023 scheduled to be shipped in January 2024.

# Market breakdown

The following table breaks down our FarmBot sales into three main market segments based on end-use of the machine: **Education**, **Personal**, and **B2B**.

The Education segment includes K-12 schools, universities, and extracurricular educational programs such as 4H and robotics clubs. The Personal segment includes homeowners, families, and DIY enthusiasts who use FarmBot non-commercially. B2B includes family farms, research facilities, farm-to-fork restaurants, and other entities that are not in the business of education.
