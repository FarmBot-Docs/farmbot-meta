# Buffer
We use a tool called [Buffer](http://buffer.com) that allows us to queue up many social media posts ahead of time and automatically publish them across multiple platforms.

# Posting guidelines
## Use emoji :heart:
**Emoji** make posts more light-hearted, emotional, engaging, and fun. Our go-to emoji are the :seedling: (seedling) and ðŸ¤– (robot face), which nicely represent "farm" and "bot". But there are literally hundreds of others out there that can be used to spice up our posts. Strive to add 1 to 5 emoji per post, but don't force it or overdo it. ðŸ––

## #FarmBot :hash:
The main hashtag we use to promote our brand and community is **#FarmBot**, and we encourage community members to use it as well. Popular places for the community to use it are [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/farmbot/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FarmBot). Try to include this hashtag in most if not all posts. It can either be used incorporated into text about #FarmBot, or just used at the end of the post. #FarmBot

## Stay focused :dart:
Posts should focus on **one subject matter** so that they are concise and easy to digest. Rather than talking about, for example, a hardware tool *and* the forum *and* making a plug for the newsletter, split the post up into two or three posts and keep each one laser focused on one bite-sized piece of information.

## Speak like a human :information-desk-person:
Even though we make and sell farming robots, we are **humans** behind the technology, company, and brand. Authenticity is the name of the game when it comes to social media and connecting with our fans and customers, so be casual, be cool, and write more-or-less how you might speak. Tips: avoid run-on sentences, short statements, and anything resembling [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM).

## Be original :art:
Nobody likes seeing the same content in their feeds all the time, so **posts should be original** or not posted at all. An exception to the rule is we can sparingly re-use content that has not been used in the last 6 months.

Furthermore, we should not use boiler-plate text that is copy/pasted to multiple posts. For example, do not copy/paste the same plug for the newsletter or the same strings of emoji onto the end of every post.

## Include media :camera:
We should strive to include an original **photo** or other piece of **media** (screenshot, video, etc) in every post, either as the main content itself or to accompany text. However, there are exceptions. We should **not** include media if we don't have anything that is high quality or relevant to the text.

## Include a link :link:
Most posts should include a **link** to our website to either buy a FarmBot, learn more, or take some action (eg: go to our blog or a page on our site, read/comment on a forum thread, subscribe to our newsletter, etc). In general, we should not include more than one link in a post because that requires just a little too much attention for most people's social media browsing habits, and most social platforms are optimized for highlighting only one link per post.

### Use our short URLs :white-check-mark:
We have the following **short URLs** which should be used as much as possible. This is especially important for Instagram, where post links are not clickable and so the follower needs to manually type in the URL to their browser if they wish to follow the link.

|URL                           |Points to                     |Use when directing people to...|
