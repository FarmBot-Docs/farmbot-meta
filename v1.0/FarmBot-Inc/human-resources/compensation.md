# Pay formula
To help us achieve pay equity, we have adopted the following formulas that apply to all of our team members:


__FarmBot Pay Formulas:__

```text
Hourly Rate = Role Base Rate x Seniority Multiplier x Experience Multiplier + Location Adjustment

Annual Salary = Hourly Rate x 2,000
```

The `Role Base Rate` is determined by the table below:

|Role                          |Base Rate                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|C-Level Executive             |$40/hour
|Lead Software Developer       |$37/hour
|Lead Hardware Engineer        |$37/hour
|Software Developer            |$33/hour
|Hardware Engineer             |$33/hour
|Designer                      |$30/hour
|Warehouse Worker              |$24/hour

The `Seniority Multiplier` is 1.0 (no effect) for team members consistently with us for under 1 year, 1.1 for those with us for over 1 year, 1.2 for over two years, and 1.3 for over three years.

The `Experience Multiplier` is subjective and can range from 1 to 1.3.

The `Location Adjustment` is used to account for the cost of living in the team member's area. It is calculated using the Cost of Living Plus Rent Index provided by the [Numbeo](http://numbeo.com) database. It is +$0 for index values 0-32, +$1 for 33-65, +$2 for 66-98, and +$3 for 99-130.

## Examples
For a C-Level Executive who has worked with us for over three years, has a medium level of experience, and lives in San Luis Obispo, the pay formulas work out as follows:


__C-Level Executive:__

```text
Hourly Rate = $40/hour (base) x 1.3 (seniority) x 1.15 (experience) + $2 (location) = $61.80/hour

Annual Salary = $61.80/hour x 2,000 = $123,600
```

For a software developer who has worked with us for 1.5 years, has a medium level of experience, and lives in Portland, the pay formulas work out as follows:


__Software Developer:__

```text
Hourly Rate = $33/hour (base) x 1.1 (seniority) x 1.15 (experience) + $2 (location) = $43.75/hour

Annual Salary = $43.75/hour x 2,000 = $87,500
```

For a warehouse worker who is just starting, has a medium-low level of experience, and lives in San Luis Obispo, the pay formulas work out as follows:


__Warehouse Worker:__

```text
Hourly Rate = $24/hour (base) x 1.0 (seniority) x 1.1 (experience) + $2 (location) = $28.40/hour

Annual Salary = $28.40/hour x 2,000 = $56,800
```
