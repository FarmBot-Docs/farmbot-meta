FarmBot Inc is legally bound to [openly share its products <span><img class="value-icon" src="_images/products.png"></span>](../../FarmBot-Inc/intro.md#openly-share-our-products) at the time of public release, including but not limited to its hardware, software, and documentation.

In doing so, we've chosen the following licenses for our works based on compliance with leading open source advocacy groups, such as the Open Source Initiative. Additionally, these licenses have been chosen to [respect your freedom](../intro/respecting-your-freedom.md) when it comes to all of our *functional* works and [maintain integrity](../intro/respecting-your-freedom.md#maintaining-integrity) when it comes to our *non-functional* works.

# Why we chose permissive licenses instead of copyleft
When selecting our open-source licenses, we had a decision to make: should the licenses be _permissive_ or _copyleft_?

**Permissive licenses** allow our direct users to distribute copies of the work (verbatim or modified) with different licensing terms if they wish. For example, someone could add a new software feature to FarmBot OS and distribute *their version* with a proprietary (closed-source) license. Any users of that modified version may not have the same [freedoms](../intro/respecting-your-freedom.md) we grant to users of *our version*, depending on the specifics of the modified version's license.

**Copyleft licenses** force everyone distributing copies of the work (verbatim or modified) to use the same licensing terms. In the case of a copyleft license that grants certain user freedoms, it means all other versions of the software are legally required to grant those same freedoms as well.

While there exist both permissive and copyleft licenses that respect user freedom, depending on your philosophy, one may be more "free" (as in freedom) than the other. Permissive licenses grant *direct users* the freedom to distribute under a different license if they choose. This freedom could be utilized by someone building a non-open business model around their modifications. Copyleft licenses protect the original license freedoms for *all users* (direct users, *and* users of all other versions). This is useful for ensuring a free work doesn't become non-free over time.

At FarmBot Inc, we have chosen permissive licenses for all of our functional work because we believe that the *freedom* for direct users to *choose* what license they distribute *their versions of the work* under is still important for innovation. In other words, we are okay with allowing non-free versions of the work to exist in order to support traditional non-open business models.

At the end of the day, even though we have granted our users with the freedom to choose what license they distribute their versions with, we encourage everyone to license their versions as freely as we have. A rising tide lifts all boats.
