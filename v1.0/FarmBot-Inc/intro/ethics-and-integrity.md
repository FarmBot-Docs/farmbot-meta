As part of our commitment to [be good people <span><img class="value-icon" src="good-people.png"></span>](../../FarmBot-Inc/intro.md#be-good-people), we strive to consider **ethics** and **integrity** when it comes to all decisions, human interactions, and technologies we create. This includes but is not limited to:

* Being kind towards each other, our customers, our partners, and the planet.
* Respecting user privacy, and carefully considering what data we collect and how we use that data.
* Ensuring our marketing, customer support, and company messaging is honest and straightforward.
* Making products that [respect user freedom](../intro/respecting-your-freedom.md), are safe and functional, and minimize damage to the environment.
* Generally trying to do what feels right in every situation.
