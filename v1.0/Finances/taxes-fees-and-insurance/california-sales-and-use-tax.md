This tax must be paid for on a quarterly basis. The amount is based on sales to California customers.

# Filing
1. Navigate to [https://onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov/_/](https://onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov/_/).
2. Click "File a Return" under the **Express Login** box, and then the "Sales and Use Tax" option.
3. Use "Option 1: Account Number and Limited Access Code" and use the **account number** and **limited access code** found in our non-public corporate documentation under the "California Sales and Use Tax" heading.
4. Proceed through the steps. The **total sales** to California customers for the quarter can be calculated using [this Shopify report](https://farmbot.myshopify.com/admin/finances/taxes). Make sure you select the correct quarter for generating the report. Then take the tax amount collected for the state and divide by the tax rate to get the total sales.
5. After filing, download the confirmation PDF. Rename it with the format `California Sales and Use Tax Q1 2018 Filing`. Then upload it to the year's tax folder in Google Drive.
